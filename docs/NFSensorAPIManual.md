# NFSensor API Reference


## Introduction


The NFSensor API includes a  programming library that allow you to write custom programs to integrate with the different Sensors distributed  by NanoFocus AG. This reference guide contains information on this library and is directed toward programmers using C languages or C++ (using the C library), who want to write their own sensor control applications for a particular sensor. For languages like C# or Python, language bindings are provided, which will be refered in supplementary documentation.


## Requirements

* Operating System Windows 10 64Bit
* ANSI C99  compliant compiler
* Tested and developed under Visual Studio 2017 Professional
* All strings handled here are zero â€“ terminated plain ASCII strings (not unicode).


## Dependencies and Distribution

NFEval Sensor API ships as a self contained zip archive and contains all binaries to operate on a specified sensor. A dependency graph can be seen in Fig. "Package Dependency". Dependend on current version, the filenames can be differ by version postfixes. In addition the package contains neccessary third party libraries as needed.

## Overview

### Plugin System

All sensor specific implementation are sourced out to a specific plugin dll which is usually located in the devices sub folder.

### Statemachine

The NFSensor API is based on a finite state machine implementation. See Fig. "State Machine Architecture" for an overview. At any given point in time the system is in a requested state or state transition and the state can be queried at any given point in time.

Fig: State Machine Architecture

The design implies that called forbidden state transition could not be possible. For example, it is not adviseable to go from state NFSensor_Acquisition to NFSensor_Live which would result in unpredicted data. Therefore the internal design prohibits such transitions and will return an error to the caller.
All states are mapped to  state ID as shown in Table 1.
```cpp
typedef enum
  {
    Unkown = 0,
    Error,
    Connecting,
    Connected,
    Initializing,
    Idle,
    Calibrating,
    Live,
    Acquisition,
    PreparingAcquisition,
    AcquiringData,
    PostProcessingAcquisition,
    IdleReady,
    IdleWithErrors,
    IdleAborted
  } StateID;
  ```
Table 1: Overview StateID

The current state can be checked with the interface function

_NFSensor_API int NFSensor_GetStateID(SensorHandle hSensor, StateID * eStateID)_

and to use  the result StateID  into  program execution flow.

### Error Handling

In general all interface functions return integer based error code. A non zero return indicates an error. Special error codes are not provided. To obtain further information in plain text you can call the API funtion

_NFSensor_API const char * NFSensor_GetLastError()_

and evaluate the null terminated ASCII string for further error tracing and debugging. Please contact your technical manual and/or service support.

### __DataHandling / Callback Functions__

* The begin and/or end  of Live state or Acquisition state  is signaled  by calling a user provided callback function. In this case no  data is associated  with the callbacks. 
* while the sensor is in Live or Acquire state the client is notified about  new  data by calling a  user provided  callback function.


### Callback Signatures

```cpp
  typedef void(*NFLiveDataCallback)(TransferData*);
  typedef void(*NFAcqDataCallback)(TransferData*);

  typedef void(*NFLiveStartCallback)(void);
  typedef void(*NFLiveDoneCallback)(void);
  typedef void(*NFAcqStartCallback)(void);
  typedef void(*NFAcqDoneCallback)(void);
```
 
###  Callback Parameters

In case of NFLiveDataCallback and NFAcqDataCallback the associated data  is returned to the caller by parameter struct TransferData:

 >### typedef struct TransferData_t


```cpp 
typedef struct TransferData_t
 {
    int64_t NX;
    int64_t NY;
    int64_t NumberOfBuffers;  
    int64_t numberOfLayers;  
    float* data_height;
    uint16_t maxIntensity;   
    uint16_t* data_intens;
    float* data_height2;
    uint16_t* data_intens2;

} TransferData;
``` 

Purpose: gives the  client access to the data, associated  with live or acquisition state. 


Fields:

* NX  [out]]: number of data points in X Dimension
* NY  [out]: number of data points along sensor line  , e.g.  NY = 128 for C3 sensor type, NY = 256  for C3x sensor type  often this is refered as number of sensor channels
* NumberOfBuffers  [out]: number of atomic data entities, in case of line scan sensors, the number of scan lines recently acquired.
  
  In live mode this value is always  NumberOfBuffers = 1.  
  
  In acquisiton state NumberOfBuffer is equal to    NumberOfBuffers   requested  with  a previously call to  NFSensor_StartAcquistion

* numberOfLayers  [out]: some sensors are capable of providing two or more layers of data, e.g. when measuring transparent layers ( upper height, lower height)    
* data_height  [out]:  pointer to  height data    
* maxIntensity  [out]: scale of intensity data, differente sensors have different A/D convertes. Usually this  value gives   maxIntensity = 255 for 8 Bit resolution or  maxIntensity = 4095 for 12 Bit resolution     
* data_intens  [out]:  pointer to intensity data
* data_height2  [out]: pointer to height data of layer 2 (in case of double layer operation)
* data_intens2  [out]: pointer to intensity data of layer 2 (in case of  double layer operation )

Remarks:
* for point sensors  NX = NY =1  holds 
* for line sensors   NX =1 ,  NY > NX  holds
* for area sensors   NX > 1  , NY > 1  holds
* the memory is allocated  by the library and the data  will overwritten  on each callback.
* care should be taken to copy the data into client space for  further processing if desired


Memory Layout:

The datalayout is ordered sequential in memory:

1. Line Sensor (C3x, C3)
 
 (B0)( (Y0 ... NY-1) ) (B1)( (Y0 ... NY-1) ) ... (NumberOfBuffers-1)((Y0 ... NY-1))
  
2. Point Sensor
   
 (B0)( (Y0) ) (B1)( (Y0) ) ... (NumberOfBuffers-1)((Y0))

### __Configuration Functions__

To reflect on  each sensor specific parameters the NFSensor API provides a generic like interface to get and set parameters. It is organized by key - value semantic and the ParamType data structure allows to pass floating point values, integer values or string values by specifiying the apropiate data type.
The get and set functions are not bound to state machine states, so it is possible to use them at any point in the program flow. It can be 
necessary for example to set certain connection parameters (e.g. IP Address ) before calling NFSensor_Connect to transit into the idle state. Though there are common parameters for all sensors, the available parameter keys are stored in a specific header file for each sensor 
shipped with the library.
