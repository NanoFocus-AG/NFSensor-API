# NFSensor-API
## Introduction


The NFSensor API includes a  programming library that allow you to write custom programs to integrate with the different Sensors distributed  by NanoFocus AG. This reference guide contains information on this library and is directed toward programmers using C languages or C++ (using the C library), who want to write their own sensor control applications for a particular sensor. For languages like C# or Python, language bindings are provided, which will be refered in supplementary documentation.
